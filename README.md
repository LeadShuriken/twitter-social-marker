# Single File Twitter Post Integration
Description:
> This is a small project to recreate
> the outstanding functionality from
> medium.com twitter integration

### The challenge:

Build a small tool that will do the following:
* Allow the user to select any text on an article
* Show a custom menu with a twitter sharing button next to the selected text
* After clicking the sharing button, the Twitter “sharing window” should appear with the selected text prefilled, ready to be tweeted.
* Vanilla JS

### Tech Needed:

* [JS] - ES5
* [TWITTER SDK] - current

### Acknowledgement

This repo uses code from:

* The Champ (https://thechamplord.wordpress.com)
* Tim Dot (https://github.com/timdown)

### Instalation

This repo contains the js you need to include in you text rich page. Mind you that the functionality now is that handling is attempted for all element. IF you want to exclude text make sure it has the "not-this-text" class or is a child of an element with it.

Extra explanations are given in code.

Enjoy.
